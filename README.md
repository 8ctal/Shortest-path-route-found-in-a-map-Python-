# Shortest-path-route-found-in-a-map-using-automata-theory-&-Python
Automatas &amp; Formal Languages project. In this project we can determinate/find a route in a previous crafted map and if the output is a list, the fastest/shortest route in that. We used automata theory with some library implementations in python.
